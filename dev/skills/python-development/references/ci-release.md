# CI and release

CI and release behavior are part of the development contract. Discover them
before changing packaging, commands, tests, or deployment-sensitive code.

## CI discovery

Inspect workflow files and scripts for:

- supported Python versions
- OS matrix
- uv install or sync command
- cache behavior
- Ruff, MyPy, and pytest commands
- coverage thresholds
- integration service setup
- release or publish jobs

Do not assume local commands are the same as CI commands. Prefer the documented
local equivalent when present.

## Release-sensitive changes

For packaging, CLI entry points, public APIs, or dependency changes, consider:

- `uv build` succeeds
- package imports after installation
- Typer CLI scripts execute
- package data is included
- version metadata is correct
- optional extras or dependency groups still resolve

## Reporting

When you cannot run CI-equivalent checks locally, say which CI job would provide
coverage and what remains unverified.
